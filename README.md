# Ext2-File-System-Simulator
An Ext2 file system simulator that I created using C as a final project for CptS 360 at WSU.<br>
This project was developed in a Linux environment and will likely only function properly in one. It is written entirely in the C language, and is intended to simulate the basic functionality of an Ext2 file system using virtual disks. The following command line commands are funcitional in the simulator: ls, cd, pwd, quit, mkdir, creat, rmdir, link, unlink, symlink, readlink <br>
## The following two sources were used in this project:
- WANG, K. C. Systems Programming in UNIX/Linux. SPRINGER, 2019. 
- Poirier, Dave. The Second Extended File System, https://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html.
